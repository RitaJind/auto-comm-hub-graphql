##  Overview

Enterprise-grade GraphQL API demonstrating scalable communication services architecture for automotive financial services. Features comprehensive schema design, nested resolvers, and real-time data management capabilities that simulate integration with CRM and communication platforms.

##  Features

### 🎯 **GraphQL Operations**
- Comprehensive query system for customer and communication data retrieval
- Mutation operations for logging communications and status updates
- Nested relationship resolvers between customers and communication logs
- Flexible filtering by customer ID, communication channel, and status

###  **Architecture Features**
- TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience
- Apollo Server integration with Express middleware
- Mock data simulation of microservices architecture
- RESTful patterns adapted for GraphQL paradigms

###  **Business Logic**
- Automotive financial services context (loan statements, payment reminders)
- Multi-channel communication support (Email, SMS, Call, App Notifications)
- Status tracking throughout communication lifecycle
- Customer preference management

##  Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5+
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Server 4+, GraphQL 16+
- **Web Framework**: Express.js
- **Development**: ts-node, UUID generation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
